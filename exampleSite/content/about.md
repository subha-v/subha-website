# Hi, I'm Subha!

I'm a Computer Science student at **Stanford University** (Class of 2028) with a passion for machine learning, natural language processing, and building technology that makes a real impact on people's lives.

## What I'm Working On

My research focuses on the intersection of AI and human interaction. I've had the opportunity to work with incredible teams at:

- **Stanford AI Lab (SAIL)** - Developing interactive image-editing platforms that integrate state-of-the-art diffusion models
- **CMU's Neulab** - Collaborating on human-in-the-loop AI systems
- **VALUENEX** - Engineering high-precision indoor positioning systems using UWB technology

## My Mission

As the CEO and Founding Engineer of **OpenNLP Labs**, I've been working since 2021 to build technology that serves underrepresented communities. Our applications have helped over 1,000+ refugees access resources in 108+ languages, and we've been fortunate to receive support from Microsoft, T-Mobile, and others - even getting featured on NASDAQ's billboard in Times Square!

## Academic Background

At Stanford, I'm diving deep into:
- Machine Learning (CS229)
- Reinforcement Learning (CS234)
- Artificial Intelligence (CS221)
- Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CS161)
- Operating Systems (CS111)
- Computer Graphics (CS148)

**GPA: 3.8/4.0**

## Research Publications

I've published research at top venues including EMNLP, ICAART, and INLG - with one paper nominated for Best Paper. My work spans topics from model compression to text simplification to interactive image editing.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to chat about ML research, startup ideas, or ways to use technology for social good. Feel free to reach out!
