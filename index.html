                    Hi! I'm Subha. I'm a student at Stanford studying Computer Science. I'm interested broadly in NLP, reinforcement learning, and making GPUs fast(er)!
                    I'm passionate about building performant systems that are accessible to all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working at Hazy Research on campus to help with their ThunderKittens work,
                    as well as advancing ethical NLP research at my nonprofit, OpenNLP Labs (join us!). In the past,
                    I've worked at Stanford's SALT lab and CMU's Neulab to develop an open-source image editing platform for culturally diverse tasks,
                    as well as developing a partial tensorization algorithm to compress transformer layers in VLMs.
                    I also organize TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon in the world, as well as help out with
                    Stanford's Machine Learning Lab (MLab) as a TA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to draw, so feel free to check out some of my art here.
                    I'm also trying to maintain a blog with my course notes and other helpful information, so please check it out!
                </p>
