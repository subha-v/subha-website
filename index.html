                    Hi! I'm Subha. I'm a student at Stanford studying Computer Science. I'm interested broadly in NLP, reinforcement learning, and making GPUs fast(er)!
                    I'm passionate about building performant systems that are accessible to all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">Hazy Research</a> on campus to help with their ThunderKittens work,
                    as well as advancing ethical NLP research at my nonprofit, <a href="https://opennlplabs.org/">OpenNLP Labs</a> (join us!). In the past,
                    I've worked at <a href="https://saltlab.stanford.edu/">Stanford's SALT</a> lab and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/">CMU's Neulab</a> to develop an open-source image editing platform for culturally diverse tasks,
                    as well as developing a partial tensorization algorithm to compress transformer layers in VLMs.
                    I also organize <a href="https://treehacks.com/">TreeHacks</a>, the largest collegiate hackathon in the world, as well as help out with
                    Stanford's Machine Learning Lab (MLab) as a TA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to draw, so feel free to check out some of my art <a href="art.html">here</a>.
                    I'm also trying to maintain a blog with my course notes and other helpful information, so please check it out!
                </p>
